  <h1>Week 3 Phase 0</h1>
  <h2>Thinking Style></h2>
  <h4>3/15/15</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      In the Gregoric Thinking Style, I am an abstract sequential thinker. I can use this style of thinking to my advantage while at DBC by applying logic in solving problems. There are some pitfalls on the list that I have to make sure I focus on so I don't fall down them. For example, it says that I would learn best when able to work alone. This is actually something I new about myself before taking the test and I have been working on getting better at working in groups. I think that the pairing sessions have been great prep work for me at getting used to working with others. I always thought that working by myself was the best approach. This was because I know that all the responsibility was on me and every decision was mine to make. Over the last few weeks I have found that I enjoy working with other people because we can bounce ideas off one another and solve problems together, thus reducing lost time by not having to research answers. It has also proved to be beneficial to look at someone elses point of view. I found myself several times trying to take over conversations with what I thought was the right idea. It was a great learning experience to find out that although what I thought did indeed work, there were other ways of thinking about it and sometimes more efficient ways of getting to the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am going to implement several plans of attack to get the most out of the experience. First is that I need to accept when I don't know something. There are so many learning opportunities gained when I just admit that I don't know something. Another strategy that I am still working on is time management. Although this week I was able to accomplish most tasks on time, I still went over on time when I went back to HTML/CSS for our GPS this week. Finally I've been working on collaborating with other people to get work done. I've been trying to be open about my strengths and struggles. I spent some of my free time this week doing little chats with people who admitted they were struggling. I felt pretty confident this week with the challenges, so I am hoping that when I hit an area where I struggle, someone will be there to help me out.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have been actively working on making my brain a more growth mindset rather than fixed. One of the things that I read is that success occurs when they work as hard as they can to be their best. This is the thinking I have been conditioning myself into. This is something that I really want, and I have been working very hard to be the best I can be. When I have struggled with something (CSS) I did not hesitate for a second to ask for help. I believe that everything can be improved and developed, so just because something is hard doesn't mean that it is impossible to do. Some things just require me to work just a little bit harder and thats OK. I am going to finish it with a quote that I wrote down from the article because I just really liked it: It's not about the result - it's about becoming the type of person who gets to enjoy those results.
