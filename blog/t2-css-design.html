     What is the difference between Margin, Padding, Border?
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I get into the technical differences between the three, I want you to think about a pool. This will make this lesson so much easier. First off, the water is the text/image/or whatever else would be inside an element. An element can be anything we put inside a tag such as a div, br, header,.... That content in between would be the water, so surrounding the water is the concrete that we use to walk around the water. This concrete area would be known as the padding. The padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. So what this means is that we can adjust how much space goes around the content (water) and the next area that is the border. We would adjust the padding to keep elements from touching one another to keep borders not as thick and to use whitespace to differentiate different boxes, or elements (or in our reference different bodies of pool water)

        This brings us to our next concept which is the border. Consider this the gate that surrounds our pool. Like gates, the border can be customized into many different ways. We can increase its thickness, style, size, shadows, and even color. Every box (body of pool water) has a border, even if it is not visible or is specificed to be 0 pixels wide. The border separates the edge of on box from another. Using borders can be extremely helpful when trying to determing where you stand with a certain element box. I sometimes like to use the border: solid black to see exactly where I stand within my web page.

      The last concept in our backyard design for our pool would be the grass that surrounds the pool. From the fenceline to the end of the property, this would be our margin. Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes. A key note is that the margin property is not inherited from parent values. So if you want to change margins, you need to do so on an individual basis.
