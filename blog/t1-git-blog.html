        What are the benefits of version control you ask? First it is important to define what the term means. Version control is a way to keep track of the changes you make to a file. It creates a way to save changes and edits of files that make up your project. Even more beneficial is the option to go back to a previous save and work from there, almost like an autosave in MS Word. However, unlike MS Word, version control allows multiple users to work on the same project without stepping on another programmers toes. The management system will allow multiple users to upload their work to a primary source, where all those files can be merged into one source document, or they can be edited more for better functionality. A popular version control management tool for programmers is called Git. Git allows an infinite number of users to write code and share and exchange their projects on the web, usually collaborating on the internet site GitHub.

        Git helps users keep track of changes in a few ways. First, and the easiest, is that everytime the programmer makes a change and commits it, it is stored in a log. If the user was simply to write git log, all previous commits will come up with the date/time they were edited and a long string to reference each individual commit. Second, when using a program like Git, as you edit and make changes to files, the user can simply type git status. This will include all changes that have been made that have yet to be pushed into a repository. In this status window, you can see what files you changed and decide if they were the right changes to make or they were incorrect and need to be changed back. Finally, another way that git keeps track of changes is on the website GitHub. There are many branches that come off the main source code and you can view what branches exist and what commits other users have made on your code. These commits are also presented in a log format.

        GitHub is a great place to store your code for a few reasons. First, it is free to use. Second, if you make your repositories public, you can share your code to the world. This has many beneficial outcomes, such as getting new ideas on how to improve your project, if you get stuck you can ask for help and somebody will be able to assist you, and reading and helping others with their projects will only make you a stronger and better programmer. Another great reason to use GitHub is purely based on its popularity. With so many users it is literally an endless world of oppurtunity and knowledge.
