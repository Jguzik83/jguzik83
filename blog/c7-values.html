  <h1>Week 7 Phase 0</h1>
  <h2>Values</h2>
  <h4>4/12/15</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      Last week we talked about stereotype threats and how people can fall into feeling bad about themselves due to believing in certain stereotypes. This week we are going to talk about how we can re-affirm our own values to make ourselves not become victims of stereotypes.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I think about myself and what I believe in, there are a few things that stand out above the rest. The first is honesty. I feel like this is probably the most important value that people should believe in and it is definitely the one that carries the most weight with me. This is because how can you ever have a good relationship with someone if you don't trust them? Over the course of my professional life, there have been many people that I didn't trust, and that was because they caused me to feel that way towards them. I always give everyone the benefit of the doubt when I first meet them that they are trustworthy, and until they prove me wrong I will always feel that way. But if you do something that makes me doubt your honesty, then it is a hard thing for me to overcome. Another value that is important to me is not being lazy. I'm not sure how to phrase that into a better way, but it's the truth. I know there are times when I'm lazy, let's be honest (see what I did there!), but if you in general are a lazy person who doesn't try at all than you and I probably won't be friends. This is not to be compared with people that have a disability because there is nothing that they can do, but people who actively choose to not be active is something that doesn't bode well with me. I feel that everyone should want the most out of the time we are given and choosing to do nothing with it is just a waste. Again, just my opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
        So at this point I am supposed to rate on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being disagree and 5 being agree, answer the following question about the values I chose: In general I try to live up to these values. (I'm also going to add a few more that I like)<br>
        Honesty: 5<br>
        Activism: 5<br>
        Will-power: 5<br>
        Order: 4<br>
        Loyalty: 5<br>
        Personal Development: 5<br>
        Fame: 1 (just wanted to point out what isn't important at all to me!)<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The last time someone asked me for advice, it was about relationship stuff. Most of the people I know usually ask me about this kind of stuff for a few reasons. The first is that I'm a good listener. It doesn't matter if you just need to vent some means things that you can't say to your significant other, or its advice about breaking up or staying together. The reason people will come to me is because I would never tell another soul what you say to me if you ask me not to. Secondly, I have a pretty great relationship with my wife and we are very open about when we are fighting with one another. I guess that people just assume that we have it all figured out because we can argue with one another one second and be fine the next. What I tell people is that there is a lot of work going on behind the scenes, and when we fight its just a form of communication that works with us. We choose not to hold things in, so although it looks like we hate each other we are actually just working through something. To each his own, but I tell people that is what works for us. So if you look at some of the values I picked out, I'm honest, loyal, active, and always trying to find a way to better myself and the person I am talking to.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I think about my own values, I feel pretty good about myself. I know that I'm a good person, not a perfect person. I make just as many mistakes as the next person, but I always try to learn from them and make better decisions next time. I don't believe that failure is a bad thing, I think its more of a learning experience. I will use this idealogy to help me succeed at DBC. I don't believe in stereotypes either, and when I hear people using them I will kindly correct them. So if while at DBC I hear people stereotyping themselves, I will kindly correct them in the exact same manner. I think if I start feeling down with myself, I will just take a step back, take a breath, regain my composure, and get back at it. The mantra that I tell myself all the time is that if it were easy, everyone would be doing it! As always, happy coding!
