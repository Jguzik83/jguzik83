  <h1>Week 9 Phase 0 </h1>

    <p>
      So I've come to the end of my Phase 0 and it was time to revisit my website. I tried really hard to get into it despite my love/hate relationship with CSS. So here is my final synopsis on the matter: I don't really mind working with HTML. It actually makes sense and I have no problems with it. My CSS is getting better, but it still isn't great. There are just so many different things you can do and manipulate that it is just hard to keep track on all the different things. I am constantly looking up different resources on the web and my HTML/CSS book looks like I have owned it for 10 years. By the way, I have owned it only for a few months. I updated my site and I think I got away from certain things that I didn't like about the first draft, but I still am not in love with the second. This is going to be a work in progress and I am just hoping that I can continue to refine my CSS knowledge until it all clicks together and makes sense.
    </p>
    <p>
        The one thing that I have noticed about other people's sites is that they just seem to have a better basic fundamental understanding of how positioning and layout works. Me on the other hand feel like I am still just learning the basics. The funniest part of the journey so far is that I have really come to enjoy coding in Ruby and JS. Even as we took a break from Ruby to learn JS, as soon as it was time to go back to Ruby I felt so much more at ease and comfortable with the coding aspects. A couple of times I threw in some JS where I should have been using Ruby, but I was able to quickly correct those errors. However, not to get away from the topic at large, I think that for me CSS is going to be a never ending learning lesson that I just cannot give up on. At some point, I am sure it is going to click for me. Some things already have, but some have not. I just have to keep practicing, which is what I intend to do.
