      Ahhh, good 'ol pairing for completing challenges. I am going to approach this week's blog in a slightly different manner. I am going to use the first paragraph to talk about how I thought I would feel about pairing before DBC and how I feel about it now as I enter week 6. Here we go!
    </p>
    <p>
        Like a frightened child, the thought of pairing with complete strangers over the internet scared me something fierce. I always found myself as a somewhat introvert when working on school related stuff: let me do it because then I'm in control of my success/failure, I will have to research more but then I will fully understand all aspects of the project, or just the fact that I like to do things at my own pace. So you can imagine that giving up all these things as a MANDATORY part of the curriculum had me worried. Then, on top of it all, how would I feel about someone knowing more than I did, or how would I react to me knowing more than someone? In the first case, are they going to think I'm dumb because I don't know what they are talking about? Should I say something if don't understand or just let it go so they don't know how clueless I am. Are they going to upset that I am wasting their time as they try to explain something to me? Or in the latter part of the example, am I going to be frustrated that I have to explain everything to them? Am I going to be upset about someone wasting my time?
    </p>
    <p>
        And now the truth of it all! The pairing is absolutely wonderful. In my experience so far, when I struggled with something that someone else knew they were very kind and patient to help me better understand. And paying it forward I have done the exact same. The internet strangers I was so afraid of before hand I new realize are people just like me, with the same amount of knowledge and experience (more or less) as I and are just as fascinated in learning all that DBC has to offer. The people I have met thus far are nice and incredibley intelligent. I think that I have learned more from working with people than I ever did by just working solo. The best parts are when we run into a challenge that neither of us knows, and we have to work together in researching a possible solution. The discussions about why something may or may not work is just spectacular. The insights that I have gained from working with other people has proven to be invaluable. As we are about to start week 6 I find myself looking forward to setting up my pairs and trying to work with new people each time. I can't express enough how great it has been to learn from everyone so far.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I read my feedback I felt really great about it. Everyone I've worked with so far has been very easy to work with and easy to exchange ideas. I actually made my wife read some of the feedback because it made me smile so much. The feedback for the most part has been extremely beneficial in sculpting how I work and behave in my pairing sessions. I think I want to implement more of a time based structure when working on different releases from the challenge. Sometimes I feel like I get to hung up on making something work rather than seeing if there is another route to take. I think that it would be better to write something that works and runs that can later be refactored rather than grinding through the process of making one thing work. I think that hardest part of feedback writing is being constructive without being abrasive.
        I haven't had any problems with anyone at this point so I feel like I am missing something because I don't have much criticism. I feel like when there was one thing that I thought could have been better, if I say something I don't want the person to think I didn't like working with them. So my thought is to lead with something positive and then tip-toe around the critique. I think that if the situation does come up where I have to say something that could come out harsh, I will review the handbook about feedback to make sure the process goes off without a hitch!
