      This week we are to write about challenges facing the tech world. I found an article that I think really encompasses something that we don't really think about, and that's the side effects of depression while forming a startup company. The first think to realize is that 90% of startups fail. If you are not comfortable with that number, than it is possible to avoid a startup yourself, especially when you consider all that goes into a startup. First off, most of the time you are the only one that believes in your startup in the beginning. It is your job, and usually your job alone depending if you have a partner or not, to convince the world why your idea is worth investing in. When you pour your heart and soul into something only to be told no can have a crippling effect on your psyche. The problem is that because you may be alone in this venture, you may not have anyone to talk to about your well-being.

        Psychologists say that the depression and anxiety they see is rooted in a lack of human connection. "Because they are so driven and do so many hours, there is a high sucess but also a high failure rate." When creating yours startup, you need to be almost obsessed with your idea and work at a rate almost un-imaginable to get it off the ground. With all that work and time devotion, you are capable of losing all communication with the rest of the world. So your feelings and emotions get stuck in your own head with no output. You work harder and harder and the stress builds and builds, until eventually you crack. You stop taking care of yourself, eating less or not at all, cease all excercising, and sometimes substance abuse.

        When a person becomes depressed, the effects can start to show up in their work. Emails can become dark and gloomy, issues can be made into bigger problems than they are, and pitches can seem less energetic and compelling to possible investors. Think about it, if you are unable to be happy about your life, how can you even begin to convince others to be happy about your ideas? The problem that exists within your head starts to show itself in everything you do. Without an outlet, suicide seems like an easy out, a finality of the depression that you just can't seem to shake.

      I thin it is important that when trying to form your startup you take into account the very real possibility of failure. Talk to someone before you dive in about how to deal with the pressures of work and how to react when you hear the word no. The best thing to do is to form friends that are also entrepreneurs before you strike out on your own. They can help you with pitfalls that you may fall into and how they were able to overcome any pitfalls themselves. The article ends with saying that "It's too late to make a friend when you need one." I think that this is a great idea to keep in the back of your mind, because if you have a person you can talk to from the beginning, you can hopefully avoid the dark thoughts of depression.

      Here is a link to the article. I think everyone should take the 5-10 minutes to give it a read. Very interesting in my opinion. <br>
