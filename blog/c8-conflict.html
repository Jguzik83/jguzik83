  <h1>Week 8 Phase 0</h1>
  <h2>Conflict</h2>
  <h4>4/18/15</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      So this week our topic for discussion is to talk about a conflict that I went through, and not necessarily the most recent. I gave it some thought I came up with what I think was the biggest conflict that I ever had to overcome. For a long time I wasn't really sure what it was that I wanted to do with my life. I graduated high school with no real passion in life and had absolutely zero idea what career I should focus on. I will never forget when my guidance counselor sat me down and said "Jason, what do you want to do with the rest of your life?" The fear that overcame me when I didn't have an answer to that. I kindly responded "That is a lot of pressure. I'm 15 years old and you want me to figure out the rest of my life?" Needless to say, upon graduating high school, I was quite unsure of said future. So I bounced around from job to job, making just enough to pay the bills (which weren't much). I started dating the woman who would be my future wife. Well, her mother worked for Hess Corporation and told me that there was a position opening up and I should apply for it. It was in the terminal department and wasn't a job, it was a career that came with excellent pay and benefits. Well I jumped at the opportunity. I landed the job after a few interviews and I began my new career. The only problem was that I soon found out this wasn't the career for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The job that I landed was terminal operator and my first year I made $82,000. That number blew my mind, for I didn't finish up college and really had no experience prior. I thought that this was the good life. I got married and bought a house, all because of the financial freedoms that were now offered to me though this job. But the dream didn't last long. The downside to this career was that an oil refinery is a constant running, never shut down environment. This means that I would be required to work shift work, which was 6 to 6, and rotated from days to nights every 2 weeks. The way the rotation worked was I was home 2 weekends every month. When I worked nights I wouldn't see my wife for days sometimes because she was getting home and I was leaving. Eventually management decided to layoff the senior guys to save money, and we all had to pick up the extra hours. So although I was making more money due to overtime, I was seeing my family less and less. It came to the point that we had money but no time to spend it, because I was either working or trying to catch up on sleep. Cold winters, hot summers, rainy hurricanes...you name it, I worked outside in it, both day and night, sometimes up to 16 hour shifts. When hurricane Sandy hit I wasn't allowed to leave the site for 8 days because we had to work around the clock to get the facility up and running. I slept on a cot in the training center. Life was miserable.

      So now that you have the precursor to everything, I can finally talk about the conflict I had to face. The conflict was do I leave the job or do I stay. If I stay I will probably die young, broken and sore, and who knows how long this marriage would last because we barely see each other anymore. On the other hand if I leave, how will I pay the mortgage, the bills, the 2 car payments, ...you get the drift. This wasn't a conflict of rage or anger, but of pure survival. I felt an overwhelming sense of panic because both outcomes seemed terrible at the time. How do I leave a guaranteed job that paid well and face a world of total uncertainty? My wife wanted me to leave, and so did I, but we had no backup plan. Nothing. Several other conflicts came up because of this, particularly between her and I because we just couldn't seem to find a solution that made sense and didn't cause us to drown financially. What we decided to do was to take a day and just think, without making any suggestions or anything, but just think. Enter the idea of a bootcamp and starting a whole new career.

      I remember first reading about DBC while at work. It was the midnight shift and it was just a really quiet night as far as work went. I was able to go online and check around, trying to find out what the hell am I supposed to do. I came across an article about DBC and how there was a strong desire for the education gained from one of these programs. I was intrigued. I went home and told my wife and together we started to research every single facet of the bootcamp. When I say we did research before starting out on this quest I truly mean we did our research. For the first time, things started to look brighter. When we decided that this was it, this was what we were looking for, I had a whole bunch of mixed emotions. Excitement of the unknown, fear of the same unkown, happy to start anew, said to say goodbye to friends...you name it, I felt it. The day that I actually quit was one of the longest days of my life. By the time I finally worked up the courage to let them know I was leaving, the day was just about over. When I left the office, I wish I could convey the great amount of relief that I felt knowing that I my days here were just about over. What originally was fear turned into a passion that would ignite myself to levels I never knew existed in me. I went out and bought a book on Ruby, read it, and then bought another. I found myself doing every coding online tutorial possible to fully immerse myself in the language. I was hooked. Which brings me to where I am right now, about to embark to the onsite learning of DBC. I honestly can't wait. Up to this point my life has been a roller coaster of ups and downs. If I could go back, I wouldn't change anything in my life. Everything I've done has made me stronger and more determined than ever before. I don't believe that mistakes are just mistakes. Everything is a learning opportunity, you just need to realize it, learn from it, and make it your own. As always, happy coding.
