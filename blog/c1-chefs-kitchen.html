      First I would like to say wow! What a week. I really can't believe all that I have already learnt. With that being said, I just watched Shereef's Fireside Chat (actually it is playing in the background still). My hope is to make this blog just a little more fun and playful than the technical blog. So, what is my take on the DBC experience: I absolutely am excited about it. The experience seems more important than the end result. What I mean by that is that the programg itself is more of a guide and someone to kick me in the rear to keep going, but how I proceed through the course is totally my decision. Do I want to just go through the 18 weeks, graduate, and hope to find a job? Well yeah, kind of, but I want to experiment with as many things as possible while here. I want to make mistakes, ask questions, and learn from them and move on. Sometimes the best lessons are learned when something doesn't work and you have to figure out why. My overall impression of DBC is that they are still in a trial and error phase. Don't take me wrong, I think they have their stuff together. I mean that the program is ever evolving and always improving, and I have a certain sense of pride knowing that my experience might change or alter some aspect of the program. Will I be reinventing the wheel? Of course not! (well maybe...) But the fact is that I think that the program will help me reach all that I want to do in my life.

        Have my expectations changed from before the video to after? I think so, but only so slightly. When I first decided to take this journey and rebirth myself in my career, I knew that it wasn't going to be easy. The mantra I've been living my life by for the past 6 months is that "If it was easy, everyone would be doing it". Now that I've gone through the first week and watched the video, I know that my original expectations were not even close to what is actually going to be expected of me. I spent a lot of time learning all about command line and git because I was given the opportunity to learn it, so why not? If someone gives you a mop and tells you that he will teach you how to use it, why not stay for entire lesson? (that is in the most simplest of forms) However, what I have to teach myself is to be better with time management and taking a break. I sat down yesterday with the Git lesson and before I knew it I had spent almost 5 hours going through all the tutorialas and demos. Granted, this was only beneficial to myself, but once the program picks up even more speed I need to focus more on the task at hand and not try and over-research everything. I think keeping notes on what I want to learn more about will help me, so when I do have down time (I doubt I will say that deeper in the program) but then I can go back and build more.

        I am extremely excited to dig deeper into the program! And at the same time I am also extremely nervous. Let me first talk about the exciting part. I have looked at graduates blogs and websites and see what they have been able to create after going through the program. I spent the last few months self teaching myself Ruby. Going through CodeAcedemy and Coderbyte, making friends in ruby groups on Facebook, and spending hours (yes HOURS) on stackoverflow. I kept at it because coming from working in an oil refinery, outside, regardless of weather, where I had no passion whatsoever in my work, I picked up a Ruby book and actually felt alive. I felt challenged again, and not on a laborous level but of an intellectual level. My brain was like "Hey, what you doing? You wanna work me? Well...its about time!" Now for the other side of the spectrum, the nervous side, I would be lying to say that the feeling isn't there. Questions race through my head "Am I going to make it" "Will I work well with others" "Will I be intimitated if my pairing partner knows more" "Will I be frustrated if I know more than them" "Is this the right decision, going to a bootcamp". If you are reading this and have any of the same questions, do what I do when I start feeling this way. Take a step back, breathe, and realize that if you want something only you are stopping yourself from getting it. Its the drive that makes me want to succeed.
