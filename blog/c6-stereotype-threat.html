  <h1>Week 6 Phase 0</h1>
  <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
  <h4>4/3/15</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      This week we were asked to read up and educate ourselves on a topic called stereotype threat. What this is is believing in a stereotype so much that it has a negative effect on your life, either academically or physically. These can be more of a troublesome area for individuals who find themselves in a minority or with a particular group that has many stereotypes about them. An example that is used: African-Americans are more likely to do poorly on the SAT's because the stereotype is that African-Americans are not as smart as other races. If you believe this to be true, you will do poorly on the test because that is what is expected from you. Not only can you do poorly on tests, but you can develop anxiety and other social inhibitions due to the stress you may be putting on yourself that you are just not as smart, or whatever the stereotype that applies to your social group.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think that falling into this type of threat is an alarming concept for me. These types of insecurities have to be started at a young age if they are going to affect you throughout your life. I say this because children are very attentive to everything going on around them. So if someone is falling into these stereotype traps they must have gotten the feeling from someone around them, probably somebody close to them. And that person must have also heard it from someone close to them. It just seems that this type of behavior is inherited from close friends or family. I can only imagine what it would be like to be a young child and before you even tried to succeed you were told you would fail because of who you are and where you came from. Something like that has to be crushing on self esteem and confidence in other aspects of your life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can say that I don't think that I ever fell under possible stereotype threat. I'm Polish, practically %100, so I've heard all the jokes about being a clutz or being stupid. "How do you confuse a Polock? Tell him to stand in the corner of a circle!" Har har har. The thing is, I always thought of myself as a pretty safe guy who never really fell over himself, and I always seemed to excel at school. I didn't let the idea that I'm an idiot effect me in any way, shape, or form. I think embracing where you come from and not letting the things other people say bother you is a huge character builder. When someone would tell me a joke, I would always come back at them with one of my own. This wasn't to be funny, although my jokes were usually good, but more towards the fact that I wanted people to see that it wasn't going to bother me. We all were able to have a good laugh and because I just swept it off, nobody thought anything of it and we all just moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now obviously my life example isn't nearly as bad as other people have had to deal with, I'm sure. But I think the one thing that separates humans from the animals is that we have the ability to form a conscious and make good decisions. Why bother reinforcing stereotypes to begin with? I know that people think they are funny and they could all share a laugh, but what about the person being stereotyped? We all have to be active in taking into account that we all are different people from different walks of life. What I find funny may be offensive to the person standing right next to me. The worst part is that person may not say anything to avoid social awkardness but it is tearing them up on the inside. Look, I'm up for a good joke, but not at the expense of another person. In this day of age, people come from all over, have all different types of family and friends, and can be from multiple races and cultures. It is practically impossible to say a stereotype that won't offend someone, so just don't say them. If we stop talking about stereotypes then they will stop being a thing. And if we can accomplish that, then I think we can all live just a little bit better with one another.
