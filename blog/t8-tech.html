      We are just about at the end of the road for our Phase 0 journey. We've been learning a lot of information about different languages, including Ruby, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, and CSS. When I think of where I was when this started and where I am now it is pretty incredible all that I've taken in. Yet what is this all for? The end goal, for all intensive purposes, was to learn Ruby on Rails. But what is RoR? It's funny that now that I am ready to begin my journey with the language, my original thoughts and inclinations have been replaced with more questions. People would ask me what is it you plan on doing with this education, and I would say Web Application Development. "Oh, so making web pages?" they would ask, to which I would reply no, its more of the framework behind the scenes. Yet now I think there is so much more to what I originally thought I would be doing, and its all very exciting!

        So the first part of Ruby on Rails is the word Ruby. What is Ruby? Ruby is a programming language that was created in the mid-1990's by Yukihiro Matsumoto. It is a language that was influenced by other programming languages such as Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp, and was created to be a genuine object-oriented language. The second part is the Rails, which is a software library that extends the Ruby programming language. Rails was created by David Hansson and is a framework for building websites. So what Rails really is is a combination of Ruby, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create a web application that runs on a web server. A web application is any software that runs in a web browser, and because it runs on a web browser, Rails is considered a server-side, or "back-end" web application development platform (the web browswer is considered the "front-end"). Rails is also called an open source language, which means that the code is shared amongst its users, who many share core values, use the same tools, and support each other with an informal volunteer network. So Rails is a set of files organized in a specific way, based on software architecture. Also a key part about Ruby on Rails is learning the phrase "Omakase", which is a Japanese phrase that means "I'll leave it to you". There is a best way to do thing with RoR, but the language is opinionated and flexible that you can also find better (the more you learn) ways to do things even when your version works.

        The last to talk about (at least for the scope of this blog) is the main Rails philosophy. The first is DRY, which stands for Don't Repeat Yourself. What this means is that your code should be unique within itself, where if you find yourself having to write the same thing over again, you can create a method that will do that same function over and over again but only have to be coded once. This concept helps make code more maintainable, more extensible, easier readable, and less buggy. Second is the convention over configuration philosophy. Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions rather than require that you specify every minutiea through endless configuration files.
