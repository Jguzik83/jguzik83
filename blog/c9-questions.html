  <h1>Week 9 Phase 0</h1>
  <h2>Questions</h2>
  <h4>4/26/15</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      Well this is it friends, the end of Phase 0. I still cannot believe all that I have learned, and even more, all that I am still going to learn. Throughout the process, there have been good times and bad times. The good times are when I am just flying through a challenge and everything is clicking and everything is working with no problems. The bad times are when I don't even know how to get my feet wet and am staring at a screen with no direction. Or when I think I have the coding correct but everytime I try and compile it I am plagued with errors. Or even worse when trying to get my CSS to function properly. So when I am totally stuck and don't know what even to google, the best practice has been to just ask the question to my accountablity group or post it on the community page. Both of these resources have been incredibly helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the first time I asked a question is was actually on Stack Overflow. I was teaching myself Ruby and had gotten totally bogged down on a challenge that I was trying to do. So at the time I didn't have any outlets so I went to SO where so many times I was able to find the answers. However this time I couldn't find the "exact" that I was looking for. So I posted my very first question on SO, and within a few minutes I had a moderator edit my question and several users give me negative checks because my question wasn't correctly asked. I even wrote in my original that I wasn't really sure how to word this but it fell onto deaf ears and my SO score was already in the red. Great, what a good way to start. However one person was kind enough to tell me how I should be asking the question. What he said has helped me in all other problems I have faced throughout this course thus far. First, don't be afraid to ask any question you may have. With that, however, are some guidelines that need to be followed. Most importantly, make sure your question is specific. You cannot ask something like what is a variable, you need to ask how does an instance variable work within a class. Second, take all the fluff out of your question. Nobody wants to hear how you are a noob and you've only been coding for a few hours. Get your exact question out there and leave out all the cuteness. You're looking for help not a reality tv show. The last thing I found out while using SO is that you need to listen to what people say and respond if it helped or not, and why or why not. This feedback and follow up helps better understand what you were trying to figure out in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now as far as being in phase 0, I have asked a few questions along the way. The best part about asking questions within the community is that when I ask something, most people know what it is I am talking about because they too have just gone over the material themselves. This allows a little more wiggle room when asking what it is that isn't working. Still some of the rules of SO applied to the community, specifically the follow through. When someone gave advice on what to do, if it didnt' work I carefully explained what still wasn't working and we would try something else. If something did work, it was imperative to explain what I did and how I got it working. By providing the most amount of detail possible, other people who may have also been struggling with something could simply read our post and follow along, and not have to wait to post their own problem and hear a response back. The biggest thing with asking a question is be specific, and be understanding and kind even when someone else's solution doesn't work. As long as you keep it positive, the conversation can continue until a solution has arrived. Well, tomorrow starts my first day of in school, so for the last "official" Phase 0 time, "Happy Coding!"
